# OpenCV Image Processing & Drawing Examples

## Overview
A collection of Python examples and tests for image processing and drawing using the OpenCV library. This project serves as a learning resource and reference for common OpenCV operations.

## Features
- Basic image loading, displaying, and saving
- Drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons)
- Adding text to images
- Image manipulation techniques
- Visual demonstrations of OpenCV functionality

## Current Examples
- **Drawing with OpenCV**: Creating shapes and text on a blank canvas
  - Lines, rectangles, circles
  - Ellipses and polygons
  - Text rendering

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for some examples)

## Installation

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the examples in action:

## Project Structure
- `drawing_opencv.ipynb`: Examples of drawing various shapes with OpenCV

## Future Plans
- Add image filtering examples
- Implement basic computer vision algorithms
- Create practical image processing applications
